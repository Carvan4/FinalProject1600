### High School Courses

___
### College Courses and Getting Your Degree
I am on my way to graduate and get my BS in [Information Technology](http://catalog.missouri.edu/collegeofengineering/informationtechnology/bs-information-technology/). I came in not knowing too much or knowing how to do that much. The University of Missouri offers a really good Information Technology program. The teachers for your courses are more than willing to help and offer many other [resources](http://catalog.missouri.edu/collegeofengineering/informationtechnology/bs-information-technology/) to give you the best information for you to succeed. These other schools could be more towards a specific aspect in the field. The program at the University of Missouri is more broad than programs at other schools. This is a way to allow an individual to find what they really like within the field.

### [Certificates](https://engineering.missouri.edu/2020/07/mizzou-engineering-adds-four-new-it-certificates/) and Internships
As I am working towards my BS in Information Technology within the engineering program at the University of Missouri I am also working to acquiring my certificate in Cyber Security. While working as an IT intern my boss allowed me to learn what the real world of being in IT is like. I helped with service desk problems, cyber security problems, going through infrastructure changes, some programming, some re-imaging computers, etc. Having an internship is a good way to learn and really learn about what it is that like about the field. 
___
### Join a Company and Get Promotions
Having those internships can help you get your foot in to that company and references for other companies. You can start anywhere the company feels fit and then show them all that you have learned and work your way up the ranks. Having experience in a little bit of everything helps give an edge because you could work in any part of the IT department.

## Is There Any [Value](https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380)?
Are there any big companies or reasonably sized companies that don't use websites or apps or put out pictures made by graphic designers? With the high need for the internet in the 21st century, there is a higher need for people in the IT field. Companies know about the high demand and how to accommodate for these needs. The field of IT is helping grow all of these companies. Now I know you want to know what the salary is... the median salary in 2020 was $91,250. That number can either be lower or higher depending on the job and how well you have proved yourself.
